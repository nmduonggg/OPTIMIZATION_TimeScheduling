### 1. Problems
N classes: 1, 2, ..., N need to be assigned.
- Each class i has t(i): number of periods needed, g(i): teacher, s(i): number of students.

M rooms: 1, 2, ..., M available.
- Each room i has c(i) number of seats.

There are 5 scholar days a week, from Monday to Friday, each day is divided into 12 periods.

(Morning: 6 periods/ Afternoon: 6 periods).

**Create a timetable for those classes satisfying the following constraints:**
1. Classes with the same teacher can not be on the same period
2. Number of students need to be smaller than number of seats

### 2. Solution
**I will divide 5 days - 60 periods into 10 blocks, each block contains 6 periods.**
- All of classes can not be assigned in 2 separated blocks
- I define a boolean variable Assign(i, m, k, b) for whether "assign class i in room b in period b of block k" or not
- Teacher can not be at the different rooms or classes simultaneously, so sum of Assign() for him/her <= 1 at each period.
  Also, the total period taught by him/her in each block cannot exceed maxperiod (6)
- A class i cannot change room during its section, then the total periods taken by it can only be 0 (not assigned) or t(i) (is assigned)
- A class i has to be assigned once in a whole week then total periods taken by it for whole week = t(i)
- One room cannot contain 2 class at the same period, then when a class i in assigned to a room j, the next t(i) - 1 periods of room j need to be blocked.

**With supports of Google OR-Tools, we can solve this problem !!!**
